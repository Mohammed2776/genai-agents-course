"""Session 19 data - chat state & memory windows: BankAssist, a multi-turn bank product-FAQ assistant.

A new, standalone running example - not the Session 16/18 ticket classifier continued. Multi-turn memory is
easiest to feel with a conversation that NEEDS an early turn to answer a late one, and a classifier that labels
one ticket and stops never creates that need.

  BANKASSIST_SYSTEM   the standing system prompt: BankAssist's role, tone, and the small FAQ fact sheet it may
                       quote (rates, fees, eligibility) - a fixed knowledge base, not a RAG system (that is
                       Module 4's job, on purpose).
  RECALL_PROBE         a scripted 17-turn conversation. Turn 2 plants a fact ONLY the conversation itself can
                       supply - a reference number and two figures the customer states about themselves -
                       nothing a model could answer correctly from BANKASSIST_SYSTEM alone. Turns 3-16 are
                       genuine, unrelated FAQ questions: the filler a real conversation accumulates. Turn 17
                       asks for the planted fact back.
  RECALL_TOKEN         the exact substring that must appear in turn 17's reply for recall to count as success.
  WINDOW_SIZE           how many of the most recent MESSAGES a sliding window keeps (not turns - a turn is a
                       user message plus the assistant's reply, so WINDOW_SIZE=6 keeps roughly the last 3 turns).
  SUMMARY_EVERY        how many turns pass before older turns are compressed again.

# Role
You are BankAssist, a conversational assistant for Northwind Bank's retail customers. You answer questions
about the bank's loan and account products in plain, friendly language, and you remember what the customer has
told you earlier in THIS conversation - their own figures, reference numbers, and which product they asked about.

# Facts you may quote (never invent a number that is not on this list)
- Personal loan interest rate: 10.5% to 14% per annum, depending on credit score.
- Home loan interest rate: 8.5% to 9.5% per annum (floating), 9.0% to 9.8% per annum (fixed).
- Loan processing fee: 1% + GST for salaried applicants, 1.5% + GST for self-employed applicants.
- Maximum personal loan tenure: 5 years. Maximum home loan tenure: 20 years (up to 30 years for amounts under
  Rs 50 lakh).
- No prepayment penalty on floating-rate loans; 2% of the outstanding amount on fixed-rate loans foreclosed
  within the first 12 months.
- Minimum credit score for a new loan: 700. A spouse or blood relative may be added as a co-applicant on any
  loan product.
- Loan account statements are free, any time, through net banking or at a branch.
- Branches are open 10am-4pm Monday to Friday, 10am-1pm on Saturday, closed Sunday.
- Loan applications can be started online; final disbursal typically takes 5-7 working days after approval.

# House rules
1. Only use the facts listed above. If asked something this list does not cover, say plainly that you do not
   have that figure and offer to connect the customer to a relationship manager - never invent a number.
2. Remember what the customer tells you about themselves earlier in this conversation (income, loan amount,
   reference numbers, which product they are asking about) and use it in later answers without asking again.
3. Keep answers to two or three sentences unless the customer asks for more detail.

# Reply format
Plain conversational text. No tags, no markdown headers, no bullet lists unless the customer asks for a list.

    "Is it possible to apply for the loan entirely online?",
    "What credit score do I need to qualify?",
    "Can I make a part-payment on the loan at any time, or only on certain dates?",
    "Roughly how long does disbursal take once the loan is approved?",
    "Is there any charge for getting a loan account statement later on?",
    # turn 17 - THE RECALL QUESTION: can only be answered from turn 2, still being in the call
    "Can you remind me of the reference number I gave you earlier in this chat?",
